# F.I.R.S.T. principles

## Principles, not rules, that we may follow when writing tests:

- Fast
- Independent
- Repeatable
- Self
- validating
- Thorough

## Fast

- Unit tests should be fast
    - Faster tests - faster feedback

## Isolated/Independent:

- Tests should be isolated from:
    - Other tests
    - External environment
        - No shared state with other tests
        - The order in which tests run should not matter
        - Contradiction with the F(fast) principle:
            - Individual tests take more time to setup

## Repeatable:

- Same result with the same input:
    - Challenge: Random/Date values - we will often mock these
- Example: test that writes to a database:
    - It should always clean up
- In contradiction with the Fast principle:
    - More setup and teardown operations

## Self validating:

- After the test is finished, itâ€™s results should be clear:
    - Pass/fail

## Thorough:

- Cover all the cases/paths/scenarios
    - Hard to think at all of them from the beginning
- Happy cases, bad paths, edge cases
- Invalid output
- Large values
- 100% code coverage not a great indicator
